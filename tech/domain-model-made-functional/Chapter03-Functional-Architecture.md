Bounded Contexts as Autonomous Software Components


Communicating Between Bounded Contexts
- Decoupling


Data Transfer Object


## "Trust Boundaries" and Validation

Anything inside the bounded contexxt will be trusted and valid, while anything outside the bounded context will be untrusted and mmight be invalid. Therefore, we sill add "gates" at the beginning and end of the workflow that acts as intermediaries between the trusted domain and the untrusted outside world. 


## Contracts Between Bounded Contexts.

- A Shared Kernel Relationship
    - share common domain design
- A Customer/Supplie (Consumer Driven Contruct) relationship
    - 
- A Confirmist relationship
    - 


## Anti-Corruption Layers
- Validation
- Translation

## ContextMap with Relationships
Context間の関係を示すのが肝要なんだな

## Workflow within a bounded context
